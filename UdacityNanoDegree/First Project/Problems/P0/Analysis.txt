           Task0
This programs runs in O(1) time (or "constant time").

            Task01
This programs runs in O(1) time (or "constant time").

            Task02
If outer loop runs n times and our inner loop runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop, 
giving us n2 total runs. Thus this program runs in O(n2) time (or "quadratic time"),ignoring all the constant time.

            Task03
Dropping all the constants and applying the samge logic as in Task02,this program runs in O(n2) time (or "quadratic time").

            Task04
This program runs in O(n2) time (or "quadratic time"). Same as Task02
